Wanaku Barn is a collection of utilities for the [Wanaku Governed Execution Proxy](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku) (formerly known as
Wanaku MCP Router). It provides the project with the OpenShift/Kubernetes operator for simplified deployment on the
cloud, a CLI that helps manage the project and tools for simplifying the administration of credentials when using
Keycloak.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to run Wanaku Barn is to install it as a plugin in Wanaku. It is already listed in the 
default catalog. When asked for the configuration, provide the address on which Wanaku Barn listens to (<http://localhost:8180>). 

Once installed, select one of the Wanaku Barn backend deliverables from the [releases page](https://github.com/wanaku-ai/wanaku-barn/releases),
unpack it and launch the process:

```shell
java -jar apps/wanaku-barn-backend/target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

You should see an Extensions menu, with several items. If you select, for instance, Data Stores, you should see:
